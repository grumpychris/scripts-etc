# scripts-etc
Contains various scripts, configs, service files for my linux preferences

These files are for my specific circumstances. They are most likely not transferable to anyone else's systems and are probably not written well or in the way anyone else would like them to be. Use any of them or parts of them at your own risk. I take no responsibility if they break your system.
